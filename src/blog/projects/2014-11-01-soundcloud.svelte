<h1>Did I Mention I've Been Writing Music?</h1>

<p>
	I recently setup a Soundcloud account to capture all the sounds and ideas that I've been making
	lately. I'm still learning guitar, and I have a lot to learn from song structure and melody, but
	it's been a fun ride here in the past month. I plan on keeping this account up to date with any of
	my latest creations/ideas. Should be a fun side project :)
