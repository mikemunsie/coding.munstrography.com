	July 14th is the big day and I really needed a website to let everyone know :) This was my first
	attempt at making a completely 100% responsive site. I wanted to take what I learned about media
	queries and see if I could make it happen. Well the result came out great and it's a nice clean
	site that works well on just about anything.

<p>Check out our site! (Update: link no longer available, Jeni became a munsie)</p>
