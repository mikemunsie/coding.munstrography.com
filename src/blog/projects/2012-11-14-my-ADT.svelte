	Just in case you were wondering, I've been working with ADT in the past 7 months on their new
	customer portal @ <a href="http://myadt.com" target="_blank">http://myadt.com</a>. So far it's
	been a pretty neat project! I've developed the mobile version of the site (we went responsive),
	created the new home page slideshow, and have helped create many of the internal pages on the
	site. I've also helped create Wireframes and had the privilege to work along side many talented
	developers to catch up with some good UX design.

<p>Long story short: I've learned quite a lot.</p>

<p>
	Since being on this project I've fallen in love with KnockoutJS, introduced to Wire-framing with
	Keynote, and of course learning much more about the truly amazing SASS. Also before this project I
	would use frameworks for creating responsive design such as <a
		href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter's Bootstrap</a
	>
	or Zurb's awesome <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>. Now I just use a classy
	mixin called
	<a href="http://thesassway.com/intermediate/responsive-web-design-part-2" target="_blank"
		>respond-to"</a
	> in which you just a pass a device you want to write queries to and it will go ahead and add those
	in for you.
