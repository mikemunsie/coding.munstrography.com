	What's so cool about this website is unlike many other blog-based agency websites, we went ahead
	and created a truly creative website representative of our company and what we are capable of
	producing. What may appear as a simple cartoony design lyes a much more complicated intricate
	design. Buzzword time: this site incorporates the single page application architecture (try
	navigating the site and you will see hashtag referencing mania) thanks to BackBoneJS, a custom
	framework built to uniquely separate the views, templates, and code that corresponds with each
	one, and alas an API built to handle custom Ajax calls. Of course needless to say there is some
	cool animation to go with it, but for the fun of it  view source some time ;)
