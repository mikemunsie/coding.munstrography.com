<h4>
	Beginning May 2, 2012 I will be joining forces with Improving Enterprises as a UX Consultant
	working with a team of developers and UX ninjas.&nbsp;
</h4>

<p>
	I feel this move was necessary on my part because as a developer I believe it's crucial to
	constantly challenge yourself. A great quote to explain everything:&nbsp;"Life begins at the end
	of your comfort zone". I feel that I'm ready to take on a challenge that will be unlike anything
	I've experience thus far. &nbsp;I will be diving deeper into the world of Responsive Design,
	Single Page Applications, Keynote, and many other areas. &nbsp;More importantly I will be getting
	a head start into doing what I've always wanted to do.
</p>

<p>I can't wait :)</p>
