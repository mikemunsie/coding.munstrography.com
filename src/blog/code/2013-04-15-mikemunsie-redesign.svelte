	So it's the year 2013 and we've been in the year for a few months now. That means that my site is
	now out of date! Okay, it really isn't, but I feel having all these squares on my site is looking
	kinda "blocky". Been looking at a lot of great sites lately and I feel my site just isn't easy to
	read.
</p>

<p>
	So with that I wanted a new design that's easier on the eyes, a bit more organized and encourages
	the user to check out my other posts, and lastly give some consistency with the colors. As I learn
	more about colors, fonts, gradients, usability, and so forth - I realize I could do a lot better.
</p>

<p>I present to you the new design (implementing soon)</p>
