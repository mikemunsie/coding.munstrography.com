	IE style sheets. I do a lot of front end web development nowadays. A few years back I would have
	said how much I think IE rocks... but times change and as the more I learn the more I realize its
	limitations. Now IE9 is pretty good and hopefully IE10 will be even better; however, still many
	people use IE7 and IE8 which is hard to get people to upgrade.

	I guess if it's not broken don't fix it... more like since you won't fix it - we will for you.
