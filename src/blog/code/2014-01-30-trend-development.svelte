	One of the things I try to do every now and then is learn what's currently trending. These days
	there are lot of really cool concepts from parallax enabled sites, tile design, objects scrolling
	into view, and of course 100% responsive websites.

	Design trends are going to constantly change and I firmly believe the best way to stay current is
	to learn how the trends are created and try to apply them. Tonight I wanted to start off with
	something small. I headed on over to thebestdesigns.com and picked a site I wanted to replicate
	(or at least get close). With that I created a small one page example that contains a full size
	background, full size google maps with overlay, links that highlight as you scroll, and some
	transitions that I thought were pretty neat (I love the blur effects, and I'm sure in the next
	post or so you might see some examples).
</p>

<p>
	Over time I plan on having a large library of designs and concepts that I have created that I can
	pick and pull from. This is more for a learning practice than anything - plus some of these trends
	are just plain fun to develop.

<p>That's all for tonight. It's 1:21 AM and I need some sleep.</p>

<p>Enjoy the big text :P</p>
