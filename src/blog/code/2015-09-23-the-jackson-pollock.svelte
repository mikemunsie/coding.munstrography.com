<h1>I made this by mistake, and it's pretty cool :)</h1>
<p>
	This is actually quite a funny story. I was working more on my sprite engine tonight and was
	adding in the ability for circle sprites. Once I got that in, I started playing around to make
	sure everything was working. So I made some circles appear and disappear, dynamically changed
	sizes, did the whole color pulse thing, and then completely geeked out to my wife to show her all
	the cool little effects I can do.
</p>
<p>
	As we joked around about all the animations I could make, I then thought it would be fun to show a
	trail of the circle as it went around the canvas. So I did that and it looked pretty cool. A few
	more experiments later, my ADD brain realized, "Hey, this looks like modern art... wait a minute,
	I want to try something!" - so then I googled Jackson Pollock and figured what the hell - why not
	try and create something similar
</p>
<p>
	So a few iterations later, I get something that looked kinda "meh" – like a blur of colors. I
	started adjusting colors and then while doing so I made a typo... this unexpected typo gave my
	image the modern effect it needed! I kept iterating and then ended up with the result you see
	here.
</p>
