<h1>My snippet got featured on CodePen!</h1>
<p>
	I spent a few hours hacking away on my own JS sprite engine yesterday and came up with a cool
	effect. I've been fascinated by the "swirly orb" effect for years now, and even have stuff dating
	back to old portfolios in 2008 and even my old MySpace (which doesn't exist). I recreated the
	effect using HTML5 canvas with some help from a new routines I created in the engine. I basically
	created a bunch of pixels that orbit around each other and then can separate and glue itself back
	together.
</p>
<p>Here's the result:</p>
<iframe
	height="300"
	style="width: 100%;"
	scrolling="no"
	title="B R E A K + G L U E"
	src="https://codepen.io/mikemunsie/embed/YyWGqg?default-tab=result&theme-id=dark"
	frameborder="no"
	loading="lazy"
	allowtransparency="true"
	allowfullscreen="true"
>
</iframe>
<p>
	When I went to show a few friends at work this morning my creation, I noticed my snippet was on
	the front page. That was cool... wait what?! Front page of Codepen?!! I had to take a double look,
	then a triple look, then logout of my CodePen and go into incognito mode... sure enough I had made
	it to the front page! So cool! I was just having fun on a Sunday afternoon hacking away at
	learning and working on my sprite engine when this happened.
</p>
<p>
	So there you have it. A work in progress and a display of some cool orbs that can come right back
	to where they started. Bookmarking this moment in time because today unexpectedly rocked :D
