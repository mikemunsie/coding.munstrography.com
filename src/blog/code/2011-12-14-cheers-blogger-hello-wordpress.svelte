	I used to have a blog with Blogger; however as the more I involve myself in code, Skyrim, and Pie
	Five Pizza, I have realized that I needed a one-stop solution for my site, Blog, and everything
	else of the like. A few of my company's clients have also been requesting WordPress sites and I
	have had to become more familiar with the framework.

<p>
	So what it all comes down to is that I like it! Although I do not prefer WordPress for creating
	websites, I do highly encourage this for blogging and for people who simply want ease of updating
	lots of content. I must say as a developer this allows my brain to take a break once in a while
	and crank some ideas via text.

<p>
	Welcome to the new site! I have converted all my old Blogger posts into the site and have migrated
	my projects from my old site, along with a few random pages in between. I should have done this a
	while ago, but it's all a learning phase into making things more efficient - and by that you can
	never stop learning.
